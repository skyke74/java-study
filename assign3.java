Today, serving as President in the 19th presidential term of the Republic of Korea, I take the first step toward a new Korea. My shoulders are now burdened with heavy mandates entrusted to me by the people, and my heart is burning with enthusiasm to create the kind of country that we have never been able to live in before.

To build such a Republic of Korea, I declare before history and the people with a fearful but humble mind that I will faithfully fulfill my responsibilities and missions as President.";

As I promised during my campaign, I will tend to the employment issue first. At the same time, I will take the initiative in reforming conglomerates.
